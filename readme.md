this is my first attempt of a game, using 'Clear Code's' tutorial called 'Creating a Stardew Valley inspired game in Python'

link for the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4IX36sP_0c&list=LL&index=2&t=13564s&ab_channel=ClearCode


for now, the code is copied word for word (retypes myself whilst trying to understand it)
once the game is complete, a lot of changes are to be made without the help of tutorials (unless desperate)

Installation
Clone/fork repo and download locally:
git clone https://github.com/Marshall168/Game1.git
Install python (works on Python 3.7)
Install pygame module:
python -m pip install pygame
Install pytmx module:
pip install pytmx
Run main.py file or run python main.py from repo directory in command terminal

Gameplay
WASD to move player
Q to change tool
E to change item in hand
SPACE to use tool
