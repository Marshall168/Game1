this is my first attempt of a game, using 'Clear Code's' tutorial called 'Creating a Stardew Valley inspired game in Python'

for now, the code is copied word for word (retypes myself whilst trying to understand it)
once the game is complete, a lot of changes are to be made without the help of tutorials (unless desperate)
