# ðŸŒ³ Stepfarm Python Game

## Description

This is my first attempt of a game, using 'Clear Code's' tutorial called ['Creating a Stardew Valley inspired game in Python'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4IX36sP_0c&list=LL&index=2&t=13564s&ab_channel=ClearCode)

For now, the code is copied word for word (retypes myself whilst trying to understand it).
Once the game is complete, a lot of changes are to be made without the help of tutorials (unless desperate).

## Installation
- Clone/fork repo and download locally: 
`git clone https://github.com/Marshall168/Game1.git`
- Install python (works on [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/))
- Install pygame module:
`python -m pip install pygame`
- Install pytmx module:
`pip install pytmx`
- Run _main.py_ file or run `python main.py` from repo directory in command terminal

## Gameplay
- `WASD` to move player
- `Q` to change tool
- `E` to change item in hand
- `SPACE` to use tool
