this is my first attempt of a game, using 'Clear Code's' tutorial called 'Creating a Stardew Valley inspired game in Python'

link for the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4IX36sP_0c&list=LL&index=2&t=13564s&ab_channel=ClearCode


for now, the code is copied word for word (retypes myself whilst trying to understand it)
once the game is complete, a lot of changes are to be made without the help of tutorials (unless desperate)
